Challenge Project: <em>Build a Website Design System</em>

Second Challenge Project from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path. A guide to styling websites using CSS.

For this project, I created a website that details three different aspects of styling a webpage with CSS: Color, Font, and Text Style.  I first built a main container for the color styling, and then just copied it twice and adjusted the content within each container according to the type of styling.  I found that this was the most efficient method of building the site as it cut down on time and made it much easier to simply "fill in the blanks."
